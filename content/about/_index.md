music lover, film lover, street-snap, <br>
most of the time, latte >= black, noodle >= rice. <br>
calm, I don't talk much, maybe not, emotional. <br>
recently, lowercase > uppercase, no any reason. <br>
feel free to contact me, if you don't have friend, <br>
"the older you get, the fewer friends you'll keep", <br> 
that's true, but also really fine, you can talk to me. <br>
we can share our music or tech skills.
